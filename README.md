# ARmuseum
Enhancing museum paintings with AR layers and AI guide. Built for ABS 2025 Finals. *The actual videos aren't uploaded here, since I don't want to deal with IP lawyers.

What it does:
-Detects museum paintings using ArUCO markers
-Overlays an AR video where the painting is moving
-Has an AI guide that you can speak with to learn more about the painting
